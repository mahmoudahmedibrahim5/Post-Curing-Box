This project is Embedded C software that runs Post Curing Box.

        It has been written using microchip studio.
        It has been tested using ATmega8A, stepper motor and few LEDs.


Description

        Post Curing Box is machine which makes surface finish for products from the 3D printers. 
        When you put the product inside box and close it then turn the machine ON the stepper motor 
        start rotaion and the UV LEDs turns ON and RGB LED Turns Blue until the time finished. 
        If you open the box while it's working motor and UV LEDs stop and RGB LED turns Red. 
        When the time finishes Motor and UV LEDs stop and RGB LED turns Green. 

It has 2 inputs
